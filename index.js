// ecmascript -> website / organisation that writes the docs / specification for all the scripting lanaguages like JS. All the theoratical stuff related to JS like Number, Booleans, Promise, Strings, arrays, Objects etc will be written by the ECMA.
// JS is scripting language that is based on the docs of the ECMA => it conforms to the docs

// NodeJS is the runtime / compiler (converts JS code into 0's and 1's) for the JS => whosoever is making the the compiler for the JS should implement the compiler according to the ecmascript docs for JS. NodeJS is based on the chromes V8 engine (compiler for JS on google chrome) + extra functionaly like 

// => every time when the ECMASCRIPT docs for JS changes the compilers that is used to run the JS should also to be get updated according to the docs

// Using NodeJS (that provides the environment to run the JS outside the browser) we can build backend applications like CLIS, Video-Player, mobile-apps, networking applications(these communicates with other machines over the internet using a protocol) (http server) using JS

// backend-applications are processes / programs that runs on machine not on the browser

// NodeJS will be used to create backend application (programs / process that runs on the machine) and the most important is the networking application (http server)

// http server (networking application) /  backend application created using NodeJS. These application are used to communicate with the machines over the internet using some protocol (http protocol / rules / regulation)

// the machines that will be communicating using the networking application (backend-application) over the internet will already know the protocol they will follow

// Through NodeJS we will be making networking application (backend application), the networking applications are used to communicate with other machines over the internet using protocols (http, webrtc etc) => the other machines over the internet will be communicating with my networking app based on some protocol and hence sharing the data with them over the internet and hitting some business logic

// Using NodeJS the networking application that we will build will based on the http protocol / we will called that application as http server
